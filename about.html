        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p class="opening-p">This is a project created for the 'Something Awesome' component of the COMP6441 Subject whilst studying at UNSW. It is intended to 
            educate developers about the potential exploits hackers can utilise and how to defend against such exploits. It does not encourage one to hack to cause public havoc, but rather an educational way to practice ethics.
            Everything can be potentially misused under the wrong hands but such tools can be used for the greater good. 
            Our objective is not to promote harmful hacking practices but to foster a deeper understanding of ethical hacking as a legitimate means of learning and safeguarding systems.
        </p>

        <p class="opening-p">It is essential to recognise that while all tools have the potential for misuse in the wrong hands, they can also be harnessed for the greater good. Understanding both the attacker and defender perspectives equips you with a comprehensive toolkit for addressing and mitigating potential security threats. 
            Therefore, it is vital to cultivate knowledge on both hacking techniques and defensive measures.
            By learning how to ethically hack and defend against attacks, developers can enhance their skills and contribute positively to the field of cybersecurity.
