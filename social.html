        <h1>Social Engineering Techniques and Case Studies</h1>
        <p>Social engineering is the one that we all look over because it's usually not technical in practice. The unusual thing about social engineering is that you could have the 
            hardest, toughest and most sophisticated safety measures in place that could still be broken into through the use of social engineering which doesn't manifest much sophisticated techniques except for hyper psychological behaviours.

        <!-- Psychological Distance and Climate Change -->
        <section id="psychological-distance" class="subsection">
            <h2>Psychological Distance Tactic</h2>
            <p>
                Psychological distance refers to the perceived gap between individuals and an issue in terms of time, space, and certainty. It is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where people often believe that its negative impacts are a future concern, geographically distant, and not directly affecting them or their community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Research by Gifford et al. (2011) highlights how people perceive climate change as temporally distant (impacting the future), geographically distant (affecting other regions), and socially distant (affecting other populations). This detachment reduces the urgency individuals feel to change their behavior or support policies aimed at climate mitigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                How do Security engineers use this knowledge? Through the use of psychological distance one can break the bridge between certain psychological issues and make it easier for one to break into a system, 
                security engineers can utilise this to manifest themselves in the attacker defender mindset which could allow them to understand what to defend from potentially attackers by understanding the attackers themselves, it's often easy to get caught up into the defender mindset however it is crucial to understand the opposite side to improve your defences.

        <section id="spiritualism-and-fraud" class="subsection">
            <h2>Spiritualism and Fraudulent Mediums</h2>
            <p>
                Spiritualism was the belief that spirits of the dead can communicate with the living. In the 1800s and especially after World War I and the Spanish Flu, which led to the loss of many loved ones. It seemed outrageous now but scientific emphasis was confined to the elites back then and in regular society it flourished primarily in English-speaking countries and drew many followers from the middle and upper classes who sought comfort in the idea of communicating with deceased loved ones. In ~1900 there were over 8 million followers in the US and Europe.
            </p>
            <h3>Harry Houdini</h3>
            <p>
                Harry Houdini was a renowned magician and he became known for debunking fraudulent mediums. His motivation was due to the grief over his mother's death and disdain for mediums attempting to exploit people’s emotions. He took it upon himself to expose fake mediums sometimes humiliating them to demonstrate that their methods were fraudulent and to make a point. One of his most famous debunking efforts was against the medium "Margery", who almost won a prize offered by Scientific American for the first medium to pass scientific scrutiny.
            </p>
            <h3>Context of Spiritualism</h3>
            <p>
                The popularity of spiritualism during World War I and the Spanish Flu was largely due to widespread grief and hardship. People sought meaning and hope in a time of uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world was in a downturn back then so the promise of being able to speak to loved ones in the afterlife was extremely appealing. This allowed many illusionists to prey into vulnerable people. Arthur Conan Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, was himself a believer in spiritualism. It's ironic because he created a character known for his rationalism and skepticism. So it's an example of how a logically rational person can fall into this thought.
            </p>
            <h3>The Spread of Fake News and Urban Myths</h3>
            <p>
                One of the early examples of fake news was Arthur Machen's short story "The Bowmen," which was mistaken for fact. This urban myth became so widely accepted that Arthur Machen himself was unable to correct it.
            </p>
            <p>
                People tend to believe comforting stories, especially during difficult times. It's a type of confirmation bias . A way of coping. This is similar to how people were willing to believe in mediums who claimed to connect them with their deceased loved ones. Mediums often used tricks and illusions to deceive people. Techniques like table rapping, cold reading, and spirit photography were common. Many mediums were debunked by Houdini and other sceptics, however it still tapped into those who were emotionally vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scientific American offered a prize to any medium who could prove their abilities under scientific scrutiny. This led to a rise in efforts to expose fraudulent mediums. Mina Crandon, aka Margery, was one of the mediums who came the closest to winning the prize. Houdini, however, played a major role in discrediting her. People were tricked because they were emotionally vulnerable and wanted to believe. Spiritualism offered hope, particularly during periods of grief and uncertainty. Mediums often relied on psychological manipulation and social engineering to create the illusion of contacting spirits.
            </p>
            <h3>Authority Bias</h3>
            <p>
                Some mediums gained a high status, and their perceived authority led people to trust them without questioning their methods.
            </p>
            <h3>Critical Thinking and Scientific Scrutiny</h3>
            <p>
                Critical thinking and scientific scrutiny are essential tools in combating fraud. Houdini emphasised the importance of evidence based thinking to prevent mediums from taking advantage of grieving people. The rise of Scientific American’s prize demonstrates the role of media and scientific communities in holding spiritualists accountable and the role of science in society's discussions in general.
            </p>
            <h3>The Protocol Should Include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Require mediums to demonstrate their powers under controlled conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled Environment:</strong> Ensure that the session is held in a neutral location, and that no tools or objects that could aid in deception are brought in by the medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Blind Tests:</strong> Include blind testing where neither the medium nor the observer knows what to expect, eliminating cues that might lead to cold reading.</li>
                <li><strong>Witnesses:</strong> Having third party observers who can verify all events and provide an unbiased perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Record the session with audio and video to provide evidence and allow further analysis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection and Takeaway</h3>
            <p>
                Spiritualism is an example of how vulnerable people can be targeted by fraudulent claims, and how deeply people want to find hope in times of distress. Although it is easy to not fall into that nowadays there are still many avenues where light has not been thrown on that we must be wary about.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe as security engineers, it is crucial to develop robust protocols to identify vulnerabilities and protect people from being deceived, both physically and digitally. Houdini's story serves as a cautionary tale for those using vulnerabilities of others whether it would be physical or emotional to exploit for their own gain.

        <!-- Benford's Law and Detecting Fraud -->
        <!-- Benford's Law and Detecting Fraud -->
<section id="benfords-law" class="subsection">
    <h2>Benford's Law and Fraud Detection</h2>
    <p>
        The surprising statistical rule that says the first digit of many real-world numbers is not uniformly random. Specifically, the digit "1" is more likely to appear as the first digit, with a probability of about 30.1%. It is used by auditors and forensic accountants to catch faked or fraudulent data. When people try to make up numbers they assume that every digit has an equal chance of being first which turns out to be incorrect in many real-world scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wanted to apply Benford’s Law myself, so I asked one of my friends to pretend they were a British politician faking an expense account.
    </p>
    <p>
        The leading digits of all 50 values.
        Here is what I found - Number of entries that start with "1": 5 out of 50, 10% of the entries.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Benford's Law, we would expect about 30% of the numbers to start with "1".
        In the experiment, the proportion of numbers that started with "1" was significantly lower, suggesting that my friend might have been faking the numbers more randomly than real data would naturally occur.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lower-than-expected frequency of the digit "1" is a common indicator of faked numbers. People tend to distribute numbers uniformly, assuming each digit has an equal chance, when in reality, "1" is disproportionately likely to be the leading digit in real datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        If my friend were aware of Benford's Law, he could have tried to match the expected distribution better but without that knowledge they unintentionally revealed that the numbers were fabricated.
    </p>
    <p>
        As provided by the course material in the 2009 Iranian Election this was used, where data anomalies suggested possible election fraud. The underlying concept is that non-additive processes often lead to a skewed distribution of leading digits. Real-life numbers, such as population statistics, financial data, and even country GDPs, often follow Benford's distribution.
        It makes Benford’s Law an excellent tool for detecting anomalies and investigating fraud, especially when it comes to expense claims or financial records.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment showed that humans are not that great at generating realistic numbers or numbers that are to do with human statistics, human lean towards uniform distributions which doesn't actually occur in natural processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practicality, for security engineers, understanding patterns like Benford’s Law can help design us make monitoring tools for detecting anomalies in financial transactions, helping to flag potentially fraudulent activities for further reviews. Hence, using Benford’s Law is a simple but powerful way to detect when numbers don’t quite add up. In this experiment, my friend's numbers deviated from the expected distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the analysis more robust I could perhaps conduct it on multiple people or use real world data and try to see it myself. It’s a simple yet powerful way to understand how statistical properties can reveal underlying patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed.

        <!-- Operation Mincemeat: A Case Study in Social Engineering -->
        <section id="operation-mincemeat" class="subsection">
            <h2>Operation Mincemeat: A Case Study in Social Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                Operation Mincemeat was a social engineering plan executed by the British during World War II, which aimed at misleading the Germans about the Allied invasion of Southern Europe, diverting all their troops to a different location to the strategic invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operation specifically targeted the high command of Germany. If they provided misleading intelligence, the goal was to convince the Germans that the Allied invasion would occur in Greece and Sardinia rather than in Sicily which would buy them a lot of time and give them significant pivot point in the battle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The British had to gather information on the movement of a neutral body (Spain) as well as understand how the Nazi intelligence network functioned and then prepare false documents that were believable and compelling enough to deceive them.
            </p>
        
            <h3>How it Succeeded:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too much reliance on intercepted documents:</strong> The Germans relied heavily on intercepted documents without questioning the authenticity of the source, likely due to optimism bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Spanish Neutrality:</strong> Even though Spain was officially neutral, the Germans assumed they would gain access to any sensitive information passed through Spanish authorities. Trusting any information from them posed a risk.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Exploited Cognitive Biases:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> The Germans already believed Greece would be a target for an Allied invasion and had stationed troops there.</li>
                <li><strong>Authority Bias:</strong> The documents appeared legitimate, enhancing their believability.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability Heuristic:</strong> Despite Spain's neutrality, the Germans valued information relayed from Spanish sources, which the Allies leveraged to their advantage.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Even when intelligence seems credible, it is crucial to validate it from multiple sources to avoid manipulation.</li>
                <li>Decisions should not be based solely on expectations or what feels right. Skepticism, objectivity, and sometimes cynicism are essential.</li>
                <li>The Germans' reliance on a single stream of intelligence weakened them. Their intelligence operations should have had multiple layers and checks in place.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Phishing Case Study: The Google Docs Phishing Scam</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                The Google Docs phishing scam, which surfaced in 2017, was one of the most sophisticated phishing attempts that exploited social engineering tactics to manipulate a vast number of users into compromising their own Google accounts. This case study examines how the attack was crafted, the psychological levers it pulled, and the lasting impact it had on both users and cybersecurity practices.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Attack Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                The phishing attack began with a realistic-looking email that appeared to come from a known contact of the recipient. This email invited the recipient to open a document on Google Docs, a widely used cloud-based platform for file sharing and collaboration. By framing the email as a document share request, the attackers leveraged the target's familiarity with Google’s platform, making the email appear legitimate and relevant to the recipient.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the recipient clicked the provided link, they were redirected to an official-looking Google page asking for permissions to access their Google account. This page, however, was not an actual Google site but a cleverly crafted lookalike designed to trick users into granting permission to a malicious app disguised as "Google Docs." In reality, this app was controlled by the attackers, who would then gain access to the user’s Google account, including emails, contacts, and other sensitive data.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Psychological Manipulation Techniques</h3>
            <p>
                Several psychological and social engineering tactics were at play in this phishing attack. Firstly, the attackers exploited **trust in known contacts**, as the phishing email appeared to come from someone the recipient knew. This familiarity lowered the recipient’s suspicion, as people are generally more inclined to trust communications from friends, family, or colleagues. By mimicking the sender’s identity, the attackers bypassed the initial skepticism that might arise from unknown or unusual contacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, the attack preyed on **urgency and curiosity**. The email’s phrasing urged recipients to open the document promptly, potentially tricking them into believing it was something work-related or important. This sense of urgency made recipients more likely to act quickly and less likely to examine the link carefully. **Authority bias** also played a role, as the email appeared to leverage the brand authority of Google, a trusted platform known for secure services.
            </p>
    
            <h3>The Attack Execution and Spread</h3>
            <p>
                Once recipients clicked through and provided access, the attackers gained full permissions over the victim’s Google account. With these credentials, they could access contacts and emails, sending out similar phishing emails to the user’s contact list and perpetuating the attack on a larger scale. This technique allowed the scam to spread rapidly, as each new victim would unknowingly expose their own contacts, creating a chain reaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scalability of this attack highlighted a critical vulnerability in permissions-based authentication systems. By impersonating Google Docs, the attackers could deploy a legitimate-looking app that mimicked Google’s official permissions screen, making it difficult for users to differentiate between a real and fraudulent application.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Impact and Lessons Learned</h3>
            <p>
                The Google Docs phishing scam impacted millions of users, exposing the ease with which a seemingly small deception could escalate into a widespread data breach. Google responded by revoking the app’s permissions and implementing stricter verification measures for third-party applications requesting access to user accounts. This attack underscored the importance of educating users about **phishing awareness**, urging individuals to carefully examine app permissions and be wary of unexpected requests, even from familiar contacts.
            </p>
            <p>
                From a cybersecurity perspective, this case reinforced the need for robust security measures, including **multi-factor authentication** and ongoing user education on how to spot phishing attempts. It also prompted improvements in email filtering systems, which are now better equipped to detect suspicious activity. For security engineers, this attack serves as a powerful reminder of how attackers can exploit both technical and psychological vulnerabilities, making user education a crucial component of any security strategy.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Preventive Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA provides an extra layer of security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access even if login credentials are compromised.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify the Source:</strong> Users should double-check the authenticity of any request, particularly those involving sensitive actions or permissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit App Permissions:</strong> Users should scrutinize permission requests and avoid granting full account access unless absolutely necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Regular security training and awareness can help users recognize the signs of phishing attacks and avoid falling victim to such scams.</li>
            </ul>
